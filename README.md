Analysis of ethical risks in autonomous weapons

This repository contains a research paper that critically examines the ethical and technical challenges associated with Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS). The project explores real-world examples such as the SGR-A1, Super aEgis II, and Guardium-LS, analyzing their implications for human accountability, international law, and AI-driven decision-making in military contexts. It also proposes frameworks for ethical oversight, risk assessment, and regulation of autonomous systems.


##  Ethical and Technical Challenges of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS)

This research paper explores the ethical, technical, and policy challenges posed by **Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS)** — weaponized AI systems capable of selecting and engaging targets without human intervention. Drawing on real-world examples like the **SGR-A1**, **Super aEgis II**, and **Guardium-LS**, the report critically examines issues surrounding human accountability, algorithmic transparency, and AI reliability in military and urban environments.

##  Project Highlights

- **Analyzed real-world LAWS deployments** (e.g., South Korea’s SGR-A1, Israeli Guardium-LS)
- **Examined ethical concerns** around human oversight, international law, and decision-making accountability
- **Outlined technical limitations** in object recognition, sensor efficacy, and dataset bias
- **Proposed regulatory solutions** including dynamic risk models, moratorium frameworks, and international cooperation
- Connected LAWS development to broader issues in **predictive policing**, **data justice**, and **AI bias**

##  Case Studies Discussed

| System | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SGR-A1**         | Autonomous sentry deployed in the Korean DMZ — explored issues of human-in-the-loop design vs. full autonomy    |
| **Super aEgis II** | Robotic turret with IR sensors and object tracking — analyzed limitations in civilian vs. combatant recognition |
| **Guardium-LS**    | Ground-based autonomous patrol unit — evaluated risk of misidentification in urban environments like Gaza       |

## Author Perspective

Written from the lens of a technologist trained in both **cybersecurity and AI ethics**, this project reflects on the risks, unintended consequences, and responsibilities engineers face when building autonomous systems.
